Pages in Storybook\n    \n      We recommend building UIs with a\n      \n        component-driven\n      \n      process starting with atomic components and ending with pages.\n    \n    \n      Render pages with mock data. This makes it easy to build and review page states without\n      needing to navigate to them in your app. Here are some handy patterns for managing page data\n      in Storybook:\n    \n    \n      \n        Use a higher-level connected component. Storybook helps you compose such data from the\n        \"args\" of child component stories\n      \n      \n        Assemble data in the page component from your services. You can mock these services out\n        using Storybook.\n      \n    \n    \n      Get a guided tutorial on component-driven development at\n      \n        Storybook tutorials\n      \n      .

server\nTo start a local development server, run:\nng serveOnce the server is running, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nAngular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:\nng generate component component-nameFor a complete list of available schematics (such as components, directives, or pipes), run:\nng generate --helpBuilding\nTo build the project run:\nng buildThis will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the dist/ directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.\nRunning unit tests\nTo execute unit tests with the Vitest test runner, use the following command:\nng testRunning end-to-end tests\nFor end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:\nng e2eAngular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.\nAdditional Resources\nFor more information on using the Angular CLI, including detailed command references, visit the Angular CLI Overview and Command
